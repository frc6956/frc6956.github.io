                    <p>The Westfield High School FIRST Robotics Competition team started, supports and mentors
                        three FIRST LEGO League (FLL) Explore teams for Westfield-Washington Township
                        Elementary School students in 1st - 3rd grade (ages 6-10).</p>
                    <h3>What is FIRST LEGO League Explore?</h3>
                    <p><strong>It's never too early to discover STEM.</strong> FIRST LEGO League Explore is designed to introduce
                        STEM concepts to kids ages 6 to 10 while exciting them through a brand they know and love −
                        LEGO®</p>
                    <p>Guided by adult coaches and FIRST® Core Values, students build models using LEGO®
                        Education WeDo 2.0 and create Show Me posters to present what they learned. The program
                        focuses on building interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) through a
                        real-world challenge – to be solved by research, critical thinking, and imagination.</p>

                    <h3>When will the Westfield Washington FLL Explore Teams meet?</h3>
                    
                    <p>The team will have ~10 official meetings between January 23rd - March 27th with an end of the
                        season celecration on a TBD date. Meeting dates will be Saturdays from 10-11:30am on Zoom.</p>

                    <h3>What does it cost to join the FLL Explore Teams?</h3>
                    
                    <p>The teams will be mentored by the high school students on the Westfield High School FRC
                        Team, SHAM-ROCK-BOTICS, along with the professionals that volunteer with the high school 
                        robotics team.</p>
                    
                    <p> In order to participate on the team, each elementary school student must pay $25 to cover the
                        cost of a team t-shirt and other supplies. Students with parents who volunteer to act as coaches
                        and attend the team meetings will have a first priority to join the team. After that, participation
                        on the team will be on a first-come first-serve basis.</p>

                    <h3>What is SHAM-ROCK-BOTICS?</h3>
                    
                    <p>SHAM-ROCK-BOTICS is creating a tight-knit community of passionate problem solvers that
                        will graduate from high school ready to take on the world! We do this through hands-on training,
                        community outreach, and intense competitions. As a FIRST Robotics Competition Team, FRC
                        6956 is based out of Westfield High School. Starting in January, students have six to eight weeks
                        to design, build, and program a 5ft tall, 120 lb robot before competition. Over the “build season”
                        students are hands-on as they learn about trade offs (speed vs. weight), how to CAD parts for the 
                        robot, basic tool and machining use, problem-solving, sensor uses, wiring, pneumatics, and
                        programming.</p>
                    
                    <p>At competitions the high school students have a short turnaround time between matches meaning
                        they have to solve problems on the fly, make decisions about what should be fixed now vs. later,
                        and learn to manage their adrenaline during those intense times. During a match, the team joins
                        an alliance with two partners to compete head-to-head, 3 vs. 3, over a 2 minutes &amp; 30 seconds
                        period. Students learn to work as a team to score as many points as possible, developing valuable
                        communication, teamwork, and leadership skills in the process.</p>
                    
                    <p>Working side-by-side professional engineers, business professionals, and teachers, students are
                        able to see how their experiences on an FRC team translates to a future career in engineering,
                        programming, business, teaching, and many other professional career paths. The high school
                        students are developing their own mentoring skills by working with the FIRST LEGO League
                        Explore program and mentoring the elementary school students.</p>
